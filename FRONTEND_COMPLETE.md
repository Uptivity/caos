## 🚀 How To Use

### Local Development

1. **Start Backend**:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start  # Runs on http://localhost:3001
```

2. **Open Frontend**:
- **Login**: Open `components/auth/login.html` in browser
- **Dashboard**: After login, you'll be redirected automatically
- **Leads**: Navigate to `components/leads/LeadsListWorking.html`
- **Tasks**: Navigate to `components/tasks/TasksWorking.html`

### Test Credentials
```
Email: admin@caos.com
Password: Admin123@
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

### Authentication Flow
- [x] Cannot access Dashboard without logging in first
- [x] Login sends POST to `/api/auth/login`
- [x] JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- [x] Logout clears tokens and redirects

### Dashboard
- [x] Shows real lead counts (not hardcoded)
- [x] Shows real task counts
- [x] User name displays from JWT data
- [x] Tasks can be marked complete
- [x] Browser console shows real API requests

### Leads Page
- [x] Can create new lead → appears in database
- [x] Can edit lead → changes saved to database
- [x] Can delete lead → removed from database
- [x] Search filters leads client-side
- [x] Statistics update when data changes
- [x] Export to CSV works

### Tasks Page
- [x] Can create new task → appears in database
- [x] Can toggle completion → updates database
- [x] Can delete task → removed from database

---

## 🎨 Design System

All pages use **SnowUI** design system:
- Consistent colors and spacing
- Responsive layouts
- Accessible components
- Modern, clean interface

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Client Pattern
Every page follows this pattern:

```javascript
// 1. Load API client
<script src="../utils/apiClient.js"></script>

// 2. Check authentication
if (!apiClient.isAuthenticated()) {
    window.location.href = '../auth/login.html';
}

// 3. Load data
async function loadData() {
    const data = await apiClient.getLeads();
    renderData(data);
}

// 4. CRUD operations
async function createItem(data) {
    await apiClient.createLead(data);
    loadData(); // Refresh
}
```

### No Mock Functions
**Verification**:
```bash
grep -r "mock" components/leads/LeadsListWorking.html  # Returns nothing
grep -r "mock" components/tasks/TasksWorking.html      # Returns nothing
grep -r "mock" components/dashboard/Dashboard.html      # Returns nothing
```

All mock functions have been removed. Every operation connects to real API endpoints.

## 📊 What's Working Right Now

### Backend API (Port 3001)
- ✅ All 240+ endpoints functional
- ✅ Authentication with JWT
- ✅ MySQL database connected
- ✅ CRUD operations for all modules
- ✅ Health checks passing

### Frontend Pages
- ✅ Login page connects to `/api/auth/login`
- ✅ Dashboard loads real data from 3 API endpoints
- ✅ Leads page: Full CRUD with 4 API endpoints
- ✅ Tasks page: Full CRUD with 4 API endpoints

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

While the core functionality is complete, you could add:

1. **Campaigns Page** - Similar to Leads/Tasks pattern
2. **Products Page** - Catalog management
3. **Calendar/Events** - Event scheduling
4. **Settings Page** - User preferences
5. **Reports/Analytics** - Charts and insights

**But the critical functionality IS COMPLETE:**
- Users can login
- Users can see their data
- Users can create, edit, and delete leads
- Users can manage tasks
- Everything saves to the database

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Old vs New Files

**DO NOT USE**:
- `components/leads/LeadsList.html` (old mock version)
- `components/tasks/Tasks.html` (old mock version)
- `components/auth/LoginForm.html` (old mock version)
- `components/auth/RegisterForm.html` (mock version)

**USE THESE**:
- `components/auth/login.html` ✅
- `components/dashboard/Dashboard.html` ✅
- `components/leads/LeadsListWorking.html` ✅
- `components/tasks/TasksWorking.html` ✅

### Production Deployment

For production (like caos.justsell.app):

1. Update `deployment/nginx.conf` to serve the working files:
```nginx
location / {
    root /usr/share/nginx/html/components/auth;
    index login.html;
}

location /dashboard {
    alias /usr/share/nginx/html/components/dashboard;
    index Dashboard.html;
}

location /leads {
    alias /usr/share/nginx/html/components/leads;
    index LeadsListWorking.html;
}
```

2. Or rename files:
```bash
mv components/leads/LeadsListWorking.html components/leads/index.html
mv components/tasks/TasksWorking.html components/tasks/index.html
```
